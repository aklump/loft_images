These attributes may be configured in LoftImages.js. &lt;div\/&gt; will use the SASS mixins for svg and retina support.  Better performance when you can embed the svg assets into your stylesheet.   Smart BG  This will add an icon 10px from the right with a 15px gap on the left of the image.  See the documentation for more details.  @include svg-smart-bg('down-chevron', right 10px center, 15px);   Aspect-ratio   If you don't have control at the server level of the aspect ratio of the image, you should use a div with a background image and the mixin loft_images_aspect_ratio.

Technically speaking, it applies padding to the element equal to the gap plus the width of the icon.    In this example the code looks like this:  $gap: 40px; $horizontal_position: 0; a.white-button {   @include svg-smart-bg('add--blue', $horizontal_position center, $gap); }   Horizontal position  With a pixel value the location is taken as that many pixels from the left edge of the element.  This is default for background position.  To move it to the right side you just need to switch to the four value background positioning of css3 like this:    $gap: 40px; $horizontal_position: 0; a.white-button {   @include svg-smart-bg('add--blue', right $horizontal_position center, $gap); }  ","tags":"","url":"smart_bg.html"}]};
